## Step 1: Generate Release Keystore

### Create Signing Key

First, generate a keystore for signing your release builds:

```powershell
# Navigate to android directory
cd android

# Generate keystore (run in PowerShell)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore anchor-release-key.keystore -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias anchor-key
```

**Important Information to Provide:**
- **Keystore Password**: Choose a strong password (save securely!)
- **Key Alias**: `anchor-key` (already specified above)
- **Key Password**: Can be same as keystore password
- **Distinguished Name**: 
  - First/Last Name: `Anchor Parking App`
  - Organization: `dash-laifu`
  - City: Your city
  - State: Your state/province
  - Country Code: Your 2-letter country code (e.g., `US`)

### Create key.properties File

Create the keystore configuration file:

```powershell
# Create key.properties in android directory
New-Item -Path "key.properties" -ItemType File
```

Add this content to `android/key.properties`:

```properties
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=anchor-key
storeFile=anchor-release-key.keystore
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning:**
- Never commit `key.properties` or `*.keystore` files to git
- Store keystore file securely - losing it means you can't update your app
- Backup keystore and passwords in a secure location

---

## Step 2: Prepare Release Build Configuration

### Update Version Information

Edit `pubspec.yaml` to set your release version:

```yaml
version: 1.0.0+1
#        ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ
#        ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Build number (increment for each release)
#        ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Patch version
#        ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Minor version  
#        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Major version
```

### Verify Build Configuration

Check that `android/app/build.gradle` is properly configured (already done in your project):

```groovy
signingConfigs {
   release {
       keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
       keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
       storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
       storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
   }
}

buildTypes {
    release {
        signingConfig = signingConfigs.release
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Build Release APK/AAB

### Option A: App Bundle (Recommended)

App bundles allow Google Play to optimize downloads for each device:

```powershell
# Clean and get dependencies
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Build App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --release
```

**Output Location:** `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### Option B: APK (Alternative)

If you prefer a traditional APK:

```powershell
# Build Release APK
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

**Output Location:** `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`

### Verify Build

Test your release build:

```powershell
# Install release APK to connected device
flutter install --release
```
